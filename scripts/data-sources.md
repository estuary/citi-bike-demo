# Data Sources used in this demo

This demo uses data from the GBFS feed provided by citi-bike.

- [Citi-Bike System Data Homepage](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
- [GBFS Feed Specification](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs)
- [GBFS JSON Schemas](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs-json-schema): These were used as a starting point, but the schemas in that repo are not actually valid json schemas, and have a number of issues.
